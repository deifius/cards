Quadzilla Solitaire 
Overview:
The object of Quadzilla is to clear all cards from the shoe and the board into the discard pile within the allotted moves. The shoe represents the cards left to be played on the board (face down). All cards from the shoe are placed face-up on the board. The board is represented by 4 columns. The discard pile represents the cards that have been cleared from the board. To clear cards from the board, 4 cards of the same suit, regardless of rank, must be in order in the same column. Those 4 cards are then cleared to the discard pile. The exception is the random Quadzilla rank of card. This rank must be cleared by getting all 4 of that rank in order in the same column without clearing one of that rank in a clearing that involves suits. The game uses a standard 52-card deck with no jokers.  
Before the First Deal:
Before the first deal, a player (or random number generator) randomly selects a rank of card (2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,J,Q,K,A) that will represent the Quadzilla for this game. That rank selected must only be cleared by getting all 4 cards of that rank in order in the same column. Clearing a Quadzilla rank card by suit means the game is over.
Allotted Moves/Difficulty:
There are 3 modes of difficulty that determine how many moves and bonus moves are given for each turn:
Easy: 3 moves are allowed each turn, with 1 extra bonus move granted each time 4 cards are cleared. Amount of moves are carried over to subsequent turns with no limit on how many moves are acquired.
Normal: 3 moves are allowed each turn, with 1 extra bonus move granted each time 4 cards are cleared. No moves are carried over from previous turns that were unused.
Hard: 3 moves are allowed each turn. No bonus moves are granted for clearings and no moves are carried over from previous turns that were unused. 
Game Play:
4 cards are dealt from the shoe, 1 into each column. The player then strategically moves the cards to set up for clearing the cards from the board in the allotted moves depending on the selected difficulty. Card(s) may only be moved onto another card(s) of the same suit or of the same rank, or an empty column. A group of ranked or suited cards may be moved together at one time provided they are moved onto the same suit or rank, or an empty column. Once there are no more allotted or possible moves available, or if the player does not wish to make any further moves, the turn is over and a new card from the shoe is placed on each column, starting a new turn. This continues until are cards are dealt from the shoe.
Winning:
To win, all cards must be cleared from the board in the allotted moves, depending on selected difficulty, on the last turn. 
Losing:
There are a couple of ways to lose:
The game is lost if there are still cards on the board after the player has exhausted all moves on the last turn.
If any of the Quadzilla rank cards for that game are cleared within a suit clear, the game is over.
Tricks:
Strategically, it is best to get your Quadzilla rank cards by themselves in a column as soon as possible. Allowing them to get mixed into other cards of the same suit will leave the player less likely to clear the Quadzilla cards and more likely to have them cleared within a suit, losing the game.
Cards in a suit clearing are cleared as the last 4 in the column. For instance, if you had 3 spades in column 1 in order and 3 in order in column 2, you have the option of moving 1, 2, or all of the spades to the other column. However, only 4 can clear, meaning if you wanted to move all of the spades from column 1 to column 2, those 3 spades from column 1 and the last spade in column 2 would clear, leaving 2 spades remaining in column 2.
